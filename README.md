# Garbage Classification
Garbage classification is a machine learning task where a model is trained to classify different types of waste into predefined categories (e.g., plastic, paper, glass, metal, organic). The goal is to automate the sorting process, which can improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

# How the Model Works:
Steps for Garbage Segmentation with Deep Learning:

1.DataPreprocessing:

Load images, perform augmentation (rotation, flipping, shifting), and normalize pixel values.

2.ModelArchitecture:

Apply CNN with convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and softmax for classification.

3.ModelTraining:

Train using Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy, early stopping, and learning rate scheduler.

4.Evaluation:

Measure accuracy/loss, create a confusion matrix, and print a classification report.

5.Visualization:

Plot accuracy and loss curves to monitor performance.

# Method used in Image Segmentation
Conventional Methods:

•Thresholding – Segments objects according to pixel intensity values.

•Edge Detection – Applies methods such as Canny edge detection to detect object boundaries.

•Region-Based Segmentation – Segments similar pixels into separate objects

# Conclusion:
Smarter waste sorting is making a real difference in managing waste more efficiently and sustainably. This project shows how automation can simplify waste disposal, reduce manual effort.
